If we have a GUI which is offering Insert,Delete,Update, Once the user submits the page there might be the chance
of resubmitting the request in following ways.

01. By Clicking on Submit/Save/Delete/Update button for multiple times
02. After submitting the request clicking refresh button in the browser
03. After submitting the request clicking back button and resubmitting the request.
